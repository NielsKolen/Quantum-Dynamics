- Quantum Dynamics - 1D and 2D:
  This file contains how to solve the 1D time-dependent Schrodinger equation and 2D time-dependent Schrodinger equation using the Crank Nicolson method.
  Using a Gaussian wave packet, we place a potential barrier for the 1D case and a double slit for the 2D case in the trajectory of the wave. In the 1D case we see quantum tunneling and for the 2D case we see interference.
